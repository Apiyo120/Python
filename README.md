Python Projects

1. Factorial Calculator: a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

2. Fibonacci Sequence: Implement a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

3. Number Guessing Game: Create a program that allows the user to play a number guessing game. The program should generate a random number and prompt the user to guess it. Provide feedback to the user based on whether their guess is too high or too low, and use recursion to allow multiple guesses until the correct number is guessed.

4. Palindrome Checker: Build a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome using recursion. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

5. Towers of Hanoi: Implement the recursive solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem. The problem involves moving a stack of discs from one peg to another with the help of a spare peg, following specific rules.

6. Directory Size Calculator: Develop a program that calculates the total size of a directory and all its subdirectories using recursion. The program should traverse the directory structure, summing up the sizes of all files encountered.
